# Analog-Clock
A fancy looking analog clock with many customizations. Very old project of mine, I have since moved to other programming languages and better coding styles

Inspired by work I saw once online (long time ago, before 2012) but crafted with many details and options

This is just one possible way to design your clock, once you do just put it anywhere on your desktop.

## Methodology

The code was crafted entierly from scratch using trigometry functions to calculate the positions of the clock hands, the backend of the drawing procedure is GDI+ in .NET Framework. This project demonstrates the basics of what can be done with Computer Graphics.
