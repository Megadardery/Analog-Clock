# Analog-Clock
A fancy looking analog clock with many customizations

Very old project of mine, I have since moved to other programming languages and better coding styles

Inspired by work I saw once online (long time ago, before 2012) but crafted with many details and options

Just one possible way to design your clock, once you do just put it anywhere on your desktop :)
